Conclusion \u00b6\n\nTo conclude, the basic data analysis was performed to identify Manhattan's Neighborhoods clusters for a short stay visit. \nDuring the analysis, we cleansed and investigated Manhattan Neighborhoods' datasets, found some statistical characteristics and visualize them.\nThe aim of this project is to help Manhattan visitors select the Airbnb neighborhoods where to stay based on the most common venues, price policy, and safety characteristics:\nif a person is interested in Entertainment (Nightlife, Pubs, Concerts, Movies) we recommend paying attention for accommodations from the Cluster 1 - Entertainment: Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, and Midtown Airbnb's Neighborhoods. But the person should take into the consideration the high prices and crime rate for this location;\nif a person is looking for a neighborhood with lower prices and nice views nearby we recommend looking at Cluster 2 - Sightseeing: Chelsea, Hell's Kitchen, and Midtown Airbnb's Neighborhoods;\nif a person does not have any preferences - investigate proposals from Cluster 0 - Mix. It has average prices and spreads over almost all Manhattan's neighborhoods.\nAreas of improvement\u00b6\nWe could include the other NYC Boroughs - The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island;\nWe also could utilize other services like Google API to find nearby Venues;\nWe have not analyzed the Hotels. It's very big chunk but we have not found any fresh public data sets about hotels accommodations with rating."}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"name": "python3", "display_name": "Python 3.7", "language": "python"}, "language_info": {"name": "python", "version": "3.7.9", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "file_extension": ".py"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 1}
